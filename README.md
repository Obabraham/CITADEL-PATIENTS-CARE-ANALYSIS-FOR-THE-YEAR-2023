To determine the distribution of medical case types (abnormal, normal, inconclusive).
To provide data-driven recommendations for improving healthcare services.
1.4. Problem Being Addressed

Healthcare facilities often struggle with efficiently managing patient data, medication inventory, and treatment trends due to fragmented or under-analyzed records. Without proper analysis, identifying overused medications, high-burden conditions, and key patient demographics becomes challenging. This report addresses the problem of data inaccessibility and mismanagement by delivering clear insights to improve clinical and administrative decisions.

2.4. Key Dataset Used

The dataset includes the following key components:

Patient Demographics: Age groups (0–19, 20–39, 40–59, 60–79, 80–99), Gender (Male, Female)
Medical Conditions Attended: Top six conditions: Arthritis, Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity, Cancer, Asthma
Medication Records: Frequency of use for key medications: Lipitor, Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Paracetamol, Penicillin
Visit and Attendance Frequency: Number of visits per patient, Most frequently attended patients
Medical Case Classification: Categories: Abnormal, Normal, Inconclusive
Billing Information: Total billing amount per patient, Top five patients by billing
Methodology

The following steps were undertaken to analyze the patient care data:

Data Collection: Patient records were extracted from Citadel’s electronic medical record (EMR) system. The dataset was filtered to include only data from January to December 2023.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Duplicate entries were removed. Data was categorized into defined fields such as age group, gender, condition type, and medication used.

Trend Identification: Top conditions, medications, and patient categories were identified based on frequency. Financial data was analyzed to highlight patients with the highest billing, revealing potential high-dependency cases.
Visualization: The final dashboard was created to provide an interactive and intuitive presentation of the data. Tools such as Microsoft Power BI/Tableau or Excel were likely used to generate the visual report.
Interpretation and Insights: Each visual component was interpreted to derive actionable insights and support healthcare strategy formulation.
3.0 STORY OF THE DATA

3.1. Data Source

The data used in this analysis originates from Citadel’s Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system, which captures all patient interactions, diagnoses, prescriptions, and billing activities. The dataset spans the full calendar year of 2023, capturing thousands of patient records and interactions across multiple healthcare service areas.

3.2. Data Collection Process

The data collection process followed a structured pipeline involving:

Automated Logging: Patient details, medications, diagnoses, and financial transactions were logged in real-time during consultations.
Back-End Extraction: Relevant data fields were extracted from the EMR backend using SQL queries and API endpoints.
Batch Processing: The data was grouped by relevant categories (e.g., age group, medication type, billing) for weekly updates.
Anonymization: Patient names were partially anonymized to protect privacy, ensuring only the most necessary identifiers (e.g., initials or frequent users) were visible in the final report.
4 DATA SPLITTING AND PREPROCESSING

4.1. Purpose

The purpose of data splitting and preprocessing in this analysis is to ensure that the patient care data from Citadel’s EMR system is accurate, complete, and ready for analysis. Clean, structured data is critical for generating reliable insights that can drive better healthcare decisions and strategic planning.

2. Data Cleaning

The raw dataset underwent a rigorous cleaning process to eliminate inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis. Steps included:

Duplicate Removal: Patient records with identical timestamps and IDs were eliminated.
Standardization: Medication names, medical conditions, and age groups were standardized (e.g., “paracetamol” and “Paracetamol” unified).
Date Format Alignment: All timestamps and billing dates were converted into a consistent format (YYYY-MM-DD).
Case Classification Correction: Manual review of vague entries in the “Case Type” field ensured proper categorization as “Normal,” “Abnormal,” or “Inconclusive.”
3. Handling Missing Values

To ensure the integrity of the data:

Demographic Gaps: Missing gender or age group entries were either imputed based on related fields or flagged and removed.
Incomplete Diagnoses: Records with blank “Medical Condition” fields were moved to an “Inconclusive” category and separated for potential manual review.
Billing Anomalies: Null or zero billing amounts were cross-validated against service logs. If no services were recorded, they were excluded from the billing analysis.
4. Data Transformation

Transformation was necessary to convert raw records into analyzable formats:

Age Grouping: Ages were bucketed into five ranges (0–19, 20–39, 40–59, 60–79, 80–99) to simplify analysis.
Visit Frequency Calculation: Patient visit counts were aggregated using unique patient IDs.
Condition and Medication Counts: Frequency metrics were generated for conditions and medications for visualization.
Billing Aggregation: Billing data was summed per patient to identify high-cost cases.
All transformations were logged and applied uniformly to maintain reproducibility.

5. Data Splitting

Although the dashboard is not predictive, if a machine learning model or forecasting system were to be developed, data splitting would occur as follows:

Training Set (70%): Used for initial exploration and model learning (e.g., for predicting abnormal cases or billing estimates).
Validation Set (15%): Used to tune parameters or evaluate models.
Test Set (15%): Final assessment of model performance.
In the current context, data was split by dimension (e.g., demographics, medication, condition, billing) for separate descriptive analysis and later merged into an integrated dashboard.
